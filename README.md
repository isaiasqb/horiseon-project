#Horiseon Website Optimization

## HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website. Accessible websites are better optimized for search engines, and help companies avoid litigation.

For this project, the task was to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. It's important to follow the Scout Rule when working with an existing codebase: Always leave the code a little cleaner than you found it. 

It's always a good idea to go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, such as by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Remember when working with a client, it is essential to read the acceptance criteria for guidance and clarity on what the client expects, especially when asked to make a judgment call, such as when an icon needs an accessible alt tag and when it is okay to leave it blank. 


## Optimization Issues Fixed 

```
* The source code NOW makes use of semantic HTML elements.
* The structure of the HTML elements NOW follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* The icon and image elements NOW have accessible alt attributes.
* The heading attributes NOW fall in sequential order.
* The title element NOW is concise and descriptive title
